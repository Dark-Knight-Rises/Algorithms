## 1. UnionFind algorithm
- **It is an eager algorithm. It solves the dynamic connectivity problem, called Quick-find.**
- **The data structure that we are going to use to support the algorithm is simply an integer array indexed by object.**
- **This is O(n^2) complexity solution because it uses two for loops, we can do better.**
